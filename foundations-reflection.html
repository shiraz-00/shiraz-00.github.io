  <p> 1. Three new things I have learnt about myself and my ego due to the core learning:
    <br>
    - My ego would make me try to avoid seeking help, I would always want to solve the issue myself even if it's holding me back.
    <br>
    - The importance of taking breaks as I would find myself sitting at the computer for long periods of time without really taking proper
      breaks from the screen.
    <br>
      - I also learned that I don't like to share personal information or details about my life to people I'm not close with.
  </p>

  <p> 2. What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?
    <br>
    The role of values, empathy, and self-awareness help shape someone into a better and more understanding person. This is important in learning
    especially in this course as we will be collaborating with others online and this will help form better relationships with our peers and
    facilitators.
  </p>

    <p> 3. What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
      <br>
      What surprised me most about the core learning is the amount of time I put into this part of foundations, as I expected most if not all
      of it to be programming. 
    </p>

<p>4. What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
  <br>
  The most challenging part about this was opening up to people I'm not that close with.
  </p>

  <p>5. Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
    <br>
    I think so much time is spent focusing on core learning is because it can help you develop other skills which are also important. Just
    being a good programmer can only get you so far compared to someone who has developed human skills. This can also help us with job interviews,
    and make it easier for us when we do find a job as we will be collaborating and working with others.
  </p>

  <p>6. Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise 
    programming instead? Justify your answer.
    <br>
    I do see how studying core learning can benefit people, however although I have learned a few things about myself I would prefer to put 
    more time into practising programming. As my main focus joining Dev Academy was to learn programming that is what I want to do with most
    of the time here. I wouldn't mind having a week of core learning or something after foundations or bootcamp is completed, but I would rather
    have my focus on one thing at a time other than programming and core learning simultaneously especially when trying to learn 
    the fundementals of coding.
