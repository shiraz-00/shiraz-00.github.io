  <p> 1. What is your long term goal or career pathway? 
    <br>
      I would like to have a career in web-development, with the long term goal of having my own business.
  </p>

  <p> 2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
    <br>
  When it comes to learning especially online, I feel I don't work to the best of my abilities when isolated I also find that I hardly ask
  for help even when I should.
  My strengths are my logical thinking and problem solving skills, my ability to learn new ideas quickly (most times).
  </p>

    <p> 3. What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      <br>
    A few skills I would like to see developed in myself while at Dev Academy is emotional intelligence, better communication skills and 
    better time management. 
    </p>

<p>4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
  <br>
  To best manage the workload in this programme, I will stick to a daily schedule and have a target I need to reach each day
  so I can stay up to date on my work and not fall behind. If things do build up and start to get to me I will first try to put in more
  hours of work to catch up but if that doesn't help I will turn to the facilitators for assistance.
  </p>

  <p>5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
    <br>
  If I find myself stuck at any point, I usually try to solve it myself first. However, if I feel as though it's taking me too long that is 
  when I will turn to my peers or facilitators in the discord for assitance.
  </p>

  <p>6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
    <br>
  All I expect of the facilitation team is to provide assistance and want me to succeed as much as I do.
